// Test script to verify AI card back visibility fix
// This script verifies that AI cards now show proper card backs during animation

console.log("Testing AI card back visibility fix...");

console.log("\nðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTED FIX:");
console.log("âœ… Modified AnimatedCard component to conditionally render content");
console.log("âœ… When isRevealed=false (AI draws): Shows generic card back with ðŸŽ´ emoji");
console.log("âœ… When isRevealed=true (human draws): Shows actual GameCard content");
console.log("âœ… Removed rotation/opacity tricks that weren't effective");

console.log("\nðŸ“‹ WHAT WAS CHANGED:");
console.log("1. AnimatedCard now renders different content based on isRevealed prop");
console.log("2. Card back design: Blue background, ðŸŽ´ emoji, 'Carte' text");
console.log("3. Proper size handling for small/medium/large cards");
console.log("4. Clean animation properties without rotation/opacity hacks");

console.log("\nðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:");
console.log("Initial Deal:");
console.log("  - Human player cards: Visible with actual content during animation");
console.log("  - AI player cards: Show card back (ðŸŽ´) during animation");

console.log("\nIn-Game Draws:");
console.log("  - Human draws from deck: Card content visible during animation");
console.log("  - AI draws from deck: Card back (ðŸŽ´) visible during animation");
console.log("  - Card transfers: Always visible (both players can see exchanged cards)");

console.log("\nðŸ§ª TO TEST MANUALLY:");
console.log("1. Open http://localhost:8082");
console.log("2. Start a game with AI opponent");
console.log("3. Watch initial deal - AI cards should show card backs");
console.log("4. Make moves that cause AI to draw - should see card backs");
console.log("5. Compare with human draws - should see actual card content");

console.log("\nâœ… VERIFICATION POINTS:");
console.log("- AI initial deal cards show ðŸŽ´ card back");
console.log("- AI draw animations show ðŸŽ´ card back");
console.log("- Human cards always show actual content");
console.log("- No rotation or transparency effects");
console.log("- Card back matches card size (small/medium/large)");
