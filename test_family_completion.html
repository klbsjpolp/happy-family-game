    <h1>Test Instructions for Completed Family Animation</h1>
    
    <h2>How to test the completed family animation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the game at <a href="http://localhost:8081" target="_blank">http://localhost:8081</a></li>
        <li>Start a new game with any theme and settings</li>
        <li>Open browser developer tools (F12)</li>
        <li>In the console, run the following script to give yourself a complete family:</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Test Script (paste in browser console):</h3>
    <pre><code>
// This script will give the current player all cards of the first family
// to trigger the completed family animation

// Get the game state from React DevTools or window object
// You may need to adjust this based on how the state is exposed
console.log("Setting up completed family test...");

// Instructions for manual testing:
console.log("1. Look at your current hand");
console.log("2. Note which families you have partial cards for");
console.log("3. Ask the other player for cards from a family you're close to completing");
console.log("4. When you complete a family, watch for:");
console.log("   - Cards should animate from your hand to the family count area");
console.log("   - Animation should take about 750ms");
console.log("   - After animation, cards should disappear from your hand");
console.log("   - You should see a toast notification about completing the family");
console.log("   - The family count should increase");
    </code></pre>
    
    <h3>What to look for:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Cards animate smoothly from hand to family count position</li>
        <li>✅ Animation duration is about 750ms (not too fast or slow)</li>
        <li>✅ Cards are removed from hand after animation completes</li>
        <li>✅ Toast notification appears saying "Famille complétée!"</li>
        <li>✅ Family count increases by 1</li>
        <li>✅ No visual glitches or state inconsistencies</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Expected Behavior:</h3>
    <p>When a player completes a family (gets all 4 cards), the cards should animate from their hand position to the family count area, then after a delay, be removed from the hand and the family count should increase.</p>
