// Test script to verify AI card draw visibility fix
// This script helps verify that AI card draws are not visible during animation

console.log("Testing AI card draw visibility fix...");

console.log("\nFixed Logic Analysis:");
console.log("- AnimationOverlay now checks gameState.players[gameState.currentPlayer].isAI");
console.log("- Instead of hardcoded gameState.players[1].isAI");
console.log("- Cards are hidden (isRevealed=false) only when:");
console.log("  1. Animation type is 'draw' AND");
console.log("  2. The current drawing player is an AI");

console.log("\nTo test this manually:");
console.log("1. Start a game with AI opponent");
console.log("2. Make a move that causes the AI to draw a card (ask for a card the AI doesn't have)");
console.log("3. Watch the animation - AI card should not be visible as it moves");
console.log("4. Compare with human player draws - human cards should be visible");

console.log("\nExpected behavior:");
console.log("✅ Human player card draws: Cards are visible (face-up) during animation");
console.log("✅ AI player card draws: Cards are not visible (face-down/hidden) during animation");
console.log("✅ Transfer animations: Cards remain visible regardless of player type");
console.log("✅ Complete animations: Cards remain visible regardless of player type");

console.log("\nThe fix ensures that only AI 'draw' animations hide the card content.");
