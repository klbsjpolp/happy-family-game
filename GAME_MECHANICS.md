# Happy Family Game Mechanics

This document details the rules and mechanics for the digital implementation of the Happy Family card game.

## Game Objective

- The goal is to collect as many complete families as possible.
- A family consists of all cards belonging to the same set (e.g., all members of a family).
- The player with the most complete families at the end of the game wins.

## Game Setup

- The deck is shuffled and six cards are distributed to every player.
- Each player starts with a hand of six cards.

## Turn Sequence

1. **Ask for a Card**
   - On your turn, you may ask another player for a family (e.g., "Do you have members from the Smith family?").
   - You must already hold at least one card from the family you are requesting.
2. **Successful Request**
   - If the asked player has at least one card, they must give all of them to you.
   - You may continue your turn and ask for another family.
3. **Unsuccessful Request**
   - If the asked player does not have any cards of that family, your turn ends.
   - You must draw a card from the deck (if any cards remain).

## Drawing Cards

- You draw a card only after an unsuccessful request.
- If the deck is empty, you do not draw a card.

## Empty Hand

- If your hand is empty at the start of your turn, draw one card from the deck (if available).
- If the deck is empty, you skip your turn.

## Completing Families

- When you collect all cards from a family, you place the complete set face up in front of you.
- Completed families are safe and cannot be taken by other players.

## End of Game

- The game ends when all families have been completed or all cards have been played.
- The winner is the player with the most complete families.
- In case of a tie, the player with the most cards in completed families wins.

## Special Notes

- Players must always ask for a card from a family they already hold.
- Bluffing is not allowed; players must answer truthfully if they have the requested card.
