// Test script to verify completed family animation
// This script will help us understand if the current implementation is working

console.log("Testing completed family animation...");

// Let's examine the current checkCompleteFamilies function behavior
// by looking at the key parts:

console.log("Animation Config:");
console.log("- cardComplete duration: 750ms (500 * 1.5)");
console.log("- Total delay before removal: 850ms (750 + 100)");

console.log("\nCurrent Implementation Analysis:");
console.log("1. checkCompleteFamilies detects when player has all 4 cards of a family");
console.log("2. Animates each card from hand to family count position with 'complete' type");
console.log("3. After 850ms delay, removes cards from player hand and adds family to completed families");

console.log("\nTo test this manually:");
console.log("1. Start a game");
console.log("2. Use browser dev tools to manually give a player all 4 cards of a family");
console.log("3. Trigger checkCompleteFamilies to see the animation");

console.log("\nLet's check if there are any issues with the current implementation...");
